## TODO:
0. Split the creation of Behavior and View, or find a nice solution to set the behavior from the model and view. 
1. Constant Block View:
* Think of a solution for displaying big numbers without changing the size of the block (maybe right-clicking on the block pops up an editing window)
3. Sum Block:
* Implement it and test it using BigDecimal, of course
* Visuals included
4. Wire Tool:
* Visual representation for I/O ports connections
* Rectangular line with editable nodes
* Smart UI tool
* Probably really hard
