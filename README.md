# OpenGPE
Graphical Programming Environment Project

## TODO:
1. Constant Block View:
* Think of a solution for displaying big numbers without changing the size of the block (maybe right-clicking on the block pops up an editing window)
2. Print Block:
* Implement the visuals
3. Sum Block:
* Implement it and test it using BigDecimal, of course
* Visuals included
4. Wire Tool:
* Visual representation for I/O ports connections
* Rectangular line with editable nodes
* Smart UI tool
* Probably really hard
