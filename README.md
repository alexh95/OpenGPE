Graphical Programming Environment Project

## TODO:
1. Constant Block View:
* Finish the view part: Center the text number
* Upgrade from Integer to BigDecimal
* Think of a solution for displaying big numbers without changing the size of the block (maybe right-clicking on the block pops up an editing window)
2. Print Block:
* Implement the visuals
3. Sum Block:
* implement it and test it
* visuals included
4. Wire Tool:
* Visual representation for connecting I/O ports
* Rectangular line with editable nodes
* probably really hard
